            As you probably don't know, Saint Augustine's College(SAC) is a well-known catholic boarding school that is best known by parents for its various activities which mainly prove its competitiveness as a whole. It has wonderful facilities and a 5-star educational system and structure. However, as we all know, nothing is perfect. Saint Augustine's College does have its problems which need to be shed light on to give the management ideas on what they should work on to improve the learning and moral involvement of her students. Hence, I, Toruka Anthony, a student of SS1 Unitas have decided to write on this topic I have concluded my points into five main problems which include;

           I have concluded my points into five main problems which include;
           <ol>
            <li>Disciplinary cases</li>
            <li>Value of food</li>
            <li>Disorderly execution of school activities</li>
            <li>Improper use of funds by the school</li>
            <li>Improper management of the dormitories by the hostel officers</li>
           </ol> 
         </p>
            <p>
               <h3>DISCIPLINARY CASES</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
               In SAC, some of the cases which have been considered and have been taken seriously by the management are eligible to be considered and taken seriously by the disciplinary committee.
<br><br>
               For example, during the second term of the 2022/2023 academic session. A disciplinary case a filed on the students Toruka Anthony and Victor Usigbe in SS1 Unitas involving the access of a teacher's cupboard to check their continuous assessment(CA) test scores on their CA notes. When they were caught, they explained to the disciplinary committee that they were given the CA notes later that day. They silently admitted that it was their fault and promised to not do it again. Although it was a minor offense, the disciplinary committee still subjected them to very cruel punishment which included embarrassment in the school assembly by flogging.

            </p>
            <p>
               <h3>VALUE OF FOOD</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
               Food is generally considered one of the most important human needs. Many Professors including economists, marketers, philosophers, and scientists have proven this fact. In SAC, the food is balanced and nutritious to an extent. But a majority of students would agree that the quantity of food given to students per meal is not enough to satisfy the student for that student to carry out the necessary daily activities on the school's agenda.
<br><br>
Sometimes, students starve all day which may result in the making of deals in exchange for food just to satisfy their hunger. One of the main disciplinary problems and banned activities declared by the school is the making of deals in exchange for food. This is the main reason that these rules are being broken by the students regularly. Another reason would be a student not liking a particular food and would persuade another student to exchange the foods that they do not like for theirs.
<br><br>
Lastly, the general food distribution is inaccurate. Doctors always say that the quantity of food one eats varies to their stage of growth. A JSS1 student wouldn't need much food as he does not do many strenuous activities compared to an SS1 student. The school should find a better way to distribute food per meal in a way that each student would get a deserved quantity of food while still getting all the required nutritional value.         </p>
                        <p>
                           <h3>DISORDERLY EXECUTION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES</h3>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Saint Augustine's College has great facilities and a great educational system, but the method or way by which the activities of the school take place is not organized. For example, there has been no term that the time of prep is equilibrium. Because of other uncoordinated activities before the prep, the time that students are supposed to use to attend their studies and read for upcoming tests or exams will be shortened which occasionally leads to them stressing themselves to burn the midnight candle when they are supposed to be sleeping for the next day.
                           <br> <br>
                           This is a big problem because students sleep for 7hrs. And sleep could be quite essential for energy. It is observed that students usually develop eye bags because of stress. Also, students who have decided to partake in external examinations and competitions have no time to concentrate because of the divided attention of their studies between the competitions and the normal school curriculum. The school does not provide enough time for the students to practice for the competition thereby adding more stress.                                    
                        </p>
                        <p><h3>IMPROPER USE OF FUNDS BY THE SCHOOL</h3></p>
                        <p>
                           Throughout the years of the school and the upcoming of new Principals once in a while. The school's current Principal, Rev Fr. Sunday Ipeh Baba, has decided to embark on major projects to improve students' well-being. Some of these projects include; Building of a new chapel(still in progress), installing solar panels, fixing the pavilion, and patching and renewing the main basketball court.
<br> <br>
                           Although this is good. The school doesn't know how to manage these projects, it is notable that they aren't procrastinating these projects but while doing this they are also handling too many projects at the same time instead of one at a time. For example, the school is working on building a new chapel which has been on for more than a year, and during this time they also embark on projects like the installation of solar panels. Relatively, the funds for this school are used for these projects. Nevertheless, the use of these funds can greatly delay the time one of these projects would have been completed. They should try to work on these projects according to their relative importance.
                           <br><br>                  
                           The building of the new chapel would be very useful to the students as the old chapel has lost its ability to accommodate the rising number of students. Solar panels are of less importance because the students can withstand the absence of constant electricity at times.

                        </p>

                           <h3>IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF THE DORMITORIES BY THE HOSTEL OFFICERS</h3>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           There are exactly five hostels in SAC namely; Hippo, Villanova, and Tolentine which are the boys' hostels, and Montefalco, Casia which are the girls' hostels. The boys' hostel officers have this unnecessary habit of waking the boys up earlier than the girls just for the benefit of the boy's earliness. Expectedly, this affects the boys' health drastically and they end up getting eye bags. The hostel officers also rush the boys to prepare early in the morning and afternoon. In the afternoon siesta is usually observed and has very little time for students to rest from class work.

<br><br>
Also, the hostel officers make such a big fuss about them losing a crucial part of their salaries as a result of poor hostel maintenance. They also do general punishment for the boys if one of the hostel officer's things goes missing. They always tend to make the hostel a living hell for the senior students which is vehemently unfair.
